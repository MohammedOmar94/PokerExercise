# Poker Exercise

The purpose of this is to determine what poker hand a user has, and which one is the winning hand of 2.

## Setup

Firstly download the project (if you haven't already).

Within the `root` folder, simply open up the `index.html` file and you're good to go! :)

To view the unit tests, uncomment lines 64-65.

## How to use

There are 2 input fields for you to write in your 5 cards. 

The characteristics of the string of cards are:
* A space is used as card seperator
* Each card consists of two characters
* The first character is the value of the card, valid characters are: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `T`(en), `J`(ack), `Q`(ueen), `K`(ing), `A`(ce)
* The second character represents the suit, valid characters are: `S`(pades), `H`(earts), `D`(iamonds), `C`(lubs)

<b>Example</b>: `2S 3S 4S 5S 6S`

Once you are ready, click the <b>Check</b> button and the
result should pop up on the screen! 

You also don't have to worry about typing in cards in the correct order since the system will recognise what you meant 
(yay for computers!).

Enjoy! :)
